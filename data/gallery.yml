        RoboCup is the largest annual robotics competition worldwide,
        with the goal to foster research in AI and robotics. TurtleRabbit is our effort for RoboCup Small Size League (SSL), where teams of autonomous robots compete in a game of football (soccer). We are developing an open-source SSL team from scratch, with a deliberate cost-effective strategy using primarily off-the-shelf electronics components and 'hobby' BLDC motors, complemented by 3D printing and CNC milling. This approach helped us to streamline the development process and, with our open-sourced hardware design, hopefully will also lower the bar for other teams to enter RoboCup competitions in the future.
