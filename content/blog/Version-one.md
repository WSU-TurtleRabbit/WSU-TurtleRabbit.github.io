Robots in RoboCup SSL do not have to follow a fixed design, but they do need to comply with some general rules. Most importantly, their size is limited to a diameter of 180 mm, and a height of 150 mm. The colourful pattern on top is used by the external vision system to identify individual robots from both teams.  The ball used in this competition is an orange golf ball.

Maybe the most distinctive element of most SSL robot designs (including ours) is their omni-wheel: the many small subwheels on the four wheels allow the robots to drive in any direction without having to turn first. In our robots, the motors sit inside the wheel.
