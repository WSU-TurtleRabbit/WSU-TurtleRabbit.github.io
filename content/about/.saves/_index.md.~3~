## This Is Our Story.

In a universe where logic is a bit wobbly and the laws of physics are more guidelines than actual rules, there exists a soccer team as unconventional as a dragon’s approach to fire safety. They’re known as TurtleRabbit, an ensemble that could only have been conceived in the depths of a particularly imaginative magic-induced dream. On the back of a colossal turtle, who swims steadily through the cosmos with worlds resting on its shell, the idea took root. The turtle, embodying the unwavering spirit and strategic genius of defense, joined forces with a rabbit, notorious for its speed and agility, albeit with a questionable sense of direction. Together, in the sprawling chaos of RoboCup, where the unexpected is the norm, TurtleRabbit is set to become a legend on the soccer field.
